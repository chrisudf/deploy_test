    - **Prerequisites**
      - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.0.0+)
      - [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

    - **Initial Setup**
    Install this starter by running from your CLI: 

    ```sh
    # Install Gatsby CLI via npm
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new cohort-go-dev https://github.com/cohortsolutions/cohortgo.dev.git
    # Nivigate to Cohort Go Dev folder
    cd cohort-go-dev/

    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
